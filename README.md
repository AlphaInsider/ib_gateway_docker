# Interactive Brokers Gateway with Docker

An easy low maintenance way of running Interactive Brokers Gateway in docker.

It includes:
- [IB Gateway Application](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=16457)
- [IBC Application](https://github.com/IbcAlpha/IBC) -
to control the IB Gateway Application (simulates user input).
- [Xvfb](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) -
a X11 virtual framebuffer to run IB Gateway Application without graphics hardware.
- [x11vnc](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/x11vnc) -
a VNC server that allows to interact with the IB Gateway user interface (optional, for development / maintenance purpose).
- [socat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat) a tool to accept TCP connection from non-localhost and relay it to IB Gateway from localhost (IB Gateway restricts connections to 127.0.0.1 by default).

## Setup and Use

### 1) Create a `docker-compose.yml` file
```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  ib_gateway:
    image: alphainsider/ib_gateway
    restart: always
    environment:
      TWS_USERID: ${TWS_USERID}
      TWS_PASSWORD: ${TWS_PASSWORD}
      TRADING_MODE: ${TRADING_MODE:-paper}
      VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD: ${VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD:-}
    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1:4001:4001'
      - '127.0.0.1:4002:4002'
      - '127.0.0.1:5900:5900'
```

### 2) Create a `.env` file in the same directory, or set the following environment variables globally:

| Variable            | Description                                | Default                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -----------------------|
| TWS_USERID          | The TWS user name.                         |                        |
| TWS_PASSWORD        | The TWS password.                          |                        |
| TRADING_MODE        | `live` or `paper`                          | paper                  |
| VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD | VNC server password. If not defined, no VNC server will be started. | not defined (VNC disabled) |

Example `.env` file:
```
TWS_USERID=username
TWS_PASSWORD=password
TRADING_MODE=paper
VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD=password
```

### 3) Run
```shell
$ docker compose up
```

After image is downloaded, container is started + 30s, the following ports will be available:

| Port | Description                                                |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4001 | TWS API port for live accounts.                            |
| 4002 | TWS API port for paper accounts.                           |
| 5900 | When VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD was defined, the VNC server port. |

**Note:** Ports are only exposed on the user's host (127.0.0.1) and are not accessible outside the user's machine.

### 4) To Stop
Press `Ctrl`+`c` on your keyboard, or if you're running it in the background, run:
```shell
$ docker compose down
```

## Config

You can configure IB Gateway and IBC through their respective config files.

| App        | File       | Container Location   | Default                                                                                           |
|------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IB Gateway | jts.ini    | /root/Jts/jts.ini    | [jts.ini](https://github.com/AlphaInsider/ib_gateway_docker/blob/master/config/ibgateway/jts.ini) |
| IBC        | config.ini | /root/ibc/config.ini | [config.ini](https://github.com/AlphaInsider/ib_gateway_docker/blob/master/config/ibc/config.ini) |   

To start the container with any changes you've made, put the updated files in your project's root directory and update `docker-compose.yml` with volumes mapping them in.

Example:
```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  ib_gateway:
    image: alphainsider/ib_gateway
    restart: always
    environment:
      TWS_USERID: ${TWS_USERID}
      TWS_PASSWORD: ${TWS_PASSWORD}
      TRADING_MODE: ${TRADING_MODE:-paper}
      VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD: ${VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD:-}
    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1:4001:4001'
      - '127.0.0.1:4002:4002'
      - '127.0.0.1:5900:5900'
    volumes:
      - ./jts.ini:/root/Jts/jts.ini
      - ./config.ini:/root/ibc/config.ini
```
## VNC IB Gateway
If you need to debug or change settings manually inside IB Gateway, you can use vnc to interact with IB Gateway GUI directly.

Steps:  
- Make sure a password is set for *VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD* in `.env`
- Spin everything up
```shell
$ docker compose up
```
- Wait 30 seconds
- Connect to the VNC server with the following details

| Setting     | Value                      |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| Server      | 127.0.0.1                  |
| Username    | admin                      |   
| Password    | (password you set in .env) |
**Note:** If you're still having issues connecting, try playing with the color depth settings.  
Remmina on Linux required color depth set to *16 bpp*.
